# Storage

# Setup

Defining a **Storage location** where files will be saved is a required step when setting up Field Book.
You can select an existing folder or create a new one.
The selected **Storage location** can be changed in the <img class="icon" src="_static/icons/settings/main/database-cog.png"> [Storage Settings](settings-storage.md).

# Subfolders

Field Book will create the following subfolders within the selected **Storage location** folder:

- `field_import`: contains files to be imported into Field Book
- `field_export`: contains exported data files
- `plot_data`: contains data associated with plots (e.g., audio, photos)
- `resources`: allows the user to access photos/documents while collecting data (e.g., rating scales, field maps)
- `database`: contains automatic and manual database export files
- `trait`: contains trait files and the disease rating customizable scale
- `archive`: stores backups when exported fields are overwritten
- `geonav`: stores log files created from the GeoNav feature

# File transfer

To add your own files to the appropriate subfolders you may need to manually transfer files from a computer.
This can be accomplished by connecting your Android device via a USB cable and changing its USB mode to allow file transfer.
Each device manufacturer has slight variations for the appearance of this dialog, but it is generally accessible from the notifications drawer.

# Internal database

Field Book uses an internal SQLite database to store imported and collected.
The database schema is modelled after the Breeding API (BrAPI) standard, and is documented in the [Field Book Wiki](https://github.com/PhenoApps/Field-Book/wiki)

The database is automatically backed up to the `database` folder at regular intervals and can be manually exported and imported in <img class="icon" src="_static/icons/settings/main/database-cog.png"> [Storage Settings](settings-storage.md).
This feature can also be used to transfer data between devices or for troubleshooting.
