# Barcodes

To improve data entry, Field Book includes built-in barcode scanning features that use the device camera to collect data or move to a specific entry.

Most Android devices are also compatible with external barcode scanners that connect via USB or Bluetooth and act as a hardware keyboard.
Scanners can be used to directly capture data from barcodes into any input field that uses the device keyboard, including many traits.

## Examples

#### Plant height

Barcoded height sticks can be used to rapidly capture plot height values.
Attaching the Android device to the stick makes it possible to accurately capture height without having to hold both the height stick and the device.
