# <img class="icon-title" src="_static/icons/formats/bug.png"> Disease Rating Trait

The disease rating trait format is used for collecting ratings of both disease incidence and severity.
It is created with a trait `name` and optional `details`.
Details text is displayed under the trait name on the Collect screen.
The incidence scale can be adjusted by editing the `disease_severity.txt` file in the `traits` folder.

On the collect screen, buttons showing numbers between **0-100** in 5 digit increments are used to record incidence, and **R**, **M**, and **S** are used to record severity.
For each measurement, only a single incidence can be recorded while severity types can be combined.
The `/` button allows varying incidence rates to be recorded (e.g., heterogenous response within a plot).
