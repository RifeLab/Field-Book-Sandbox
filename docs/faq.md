How do I cite Field Book?
-------------------------

If you use Field Book for research, please cite the following journal article:

[Rife, T.W., and J.A. Poland. 2014. Field Book: An Open-Source Application for Field Data Collection on Android. Crop Sci. 54(4): 1624â€“1627.](http://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2013.08.0579)

How do I prepare files for Field Book?
--------------------------------------

First, consider whether it's possible to import data without prepping your own custom files.
Data imports that use the Breeding API (BrAPI) or files generated by a breeding database can eliminate extra work, reduce the risk of error, and bundle in useful contextual data.

If it is necessary to prepare your own custom files:

- Custom fields can be loaded by preparing a spreadsheet.
The required information is detailed in the <a href="fields.md"><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="_static/icons/home/view-module.png" width="20px"></a> [Fields](fields.md) section of the docs.
The app comes with a handful of sample fields that are loaded from files, so you can also look at `field_sample.csv` in the `/field_import` folder for guidance.

- Custom traits are best created directly in the app, but can be saved to and loaded from a `.trt` file.
The `.trt` extension is not a special format; it is just a `.csv` file by a different name, so `.trt` files can be opened and edited if needed.

What filetypes are compatible with Field Book?
----------------------------------------------

Custom fields can be loaded by preparing a spreadsheet in `.csv`, `.xls`, or `.xlsx` format.
For multi-sheet spreadsheets, Field Book only accesses the first sheet. 

What are the recommended devices for Field Book?
------------------------------------------------

Field Book is designed to work on any modern Android device (~10 years old or less).
When choosing between Android devices, consider where and how you will be using the app.

We tend to recommend smartphones as the best choice if you will be carrying the device (lightweight), taking photos (higher image quality), or connecting to the internet in the field (SIM slot for mobile data).
Among smartphones, we recommend [Google Pixel devices](https://store.google.com/category/phones) for the simplicity of their user interface (stock android), as well as their higher-than-average image quality and GPS accuracy.
We use Pixels when developing and testing new versions of Field Book.

In cases when screen visibility in full sunlight is a concern we recommend e-ink devices like the [BOOX Palma](https://shop.boox.com/products/palma).

We maintain a full list of [hardware recommendations](https://www.phenoapps.org/hardware/), including accessory devices, on the Phenoapps website.

How do I request a new feature?

This is important to prevent duplication.
If a request already exists, you add your input by making a comment.
